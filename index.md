# Today's themes

* PhD: The best thing I'll never do again

--
* Life after academia

--
* Rust in the olden days

--
* Key moments and lessons

--
* Help wanted: interfacing with academia

---

# Who is this guy?

---

# My path

* 2001: Graduated MIT

--
* 2001‚Äì2004: Wrote a JIT for XSLT -- "wirespeed" XML!

--
* 2004-2011: PhD at ETH Zurich

--
* 2011-2024: Watching Rust grow

# TIL<sup>1</sup>: Nobody knows where they are going

Something I've never heard anyone successful say:

* "I had it all planned out from the beginning"

.footnote[
    <sup>1</sup> I consider TIL to mean "Things I learned", not "Today I learned". Sue me.
]

???

True at every stage. Including thesis:

* Pick something and start exploring.
* Ideas will come.

---

# TIL: The research spiral

You WILL feel like you are going in circles. A lot.

---

# TIL: Academics by and large give terrible talks

Present company excepted, of course.

--

EMOREJOKES people

---

# TIL: Professors are nice

OK, mostly.

--

.p60[![Me as kid](./images/me-as-kid.jpg)]

Don't be shy!

---

# TIL: Professors don't know everything<sup>1</sup>

Don't tell anyone.

    <sup>1</sup> Reviewing these slides, my wife asked me to put, "but my wife does". No comment.

# What I got out of my PhD

* (let's be honest) the "union card"

--
* time to read [TAPL](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) cover to cover (recommended)

--
* the ability to decrypt academic papers üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

--
* met a bunch of amazing people
    * (a trend that continues to literally this minute with y'all!)

--

most importantly:

* the confidence to dive into an area, get oriented, and make a contribution

---

# What I did NOT get out of my PhD

--

* a strong publication record üò®

---

# TIL: Research happens everywhere

--

What I really like:

* Diving deep into new things
* Polishing ideas until they are smooth
* Communicating clearly
* Seeing the things I've helped to build empower others

--
* Getting paid ü§ë

--

All possible in academia and industry, some easier than others

---
# Rust in the early days

Before me:

* Implemented in Ocaml, the infamous "rustboot"
* Became self-hosting

We did not know where we were going

or how we were going to get there

but we knew how it should feel once we got there

# The sigils

Pointer patterns:

* `T` -- by value
* `@T` -- GC'd value, now `Rc<T>` or `Arc<T>`
* `~T` -- owned value, now `Box<T>`

--

Parameter modes
* `&x: T`, mutable reference (now, `x: &mut T`)
* `&&x: T`, const reference (now, `x: &T`)
* `-x: T`, "by move" (now, `x: T` where `T: !Copy`)
* `+x: T`, "by copy" (now, `x: T` and `x.clone()` at the callsite)
--

* `++x: T`, "by crash"

---

# Unsound

```

        log p.hash;

# "Sharing xor mutation"

All of these have two things in common:

* Aliasing
* Mutation

.footnote[
    I remember we gained a lot from Dan Grossman's [Existential Types for Imperative Languages](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djg/papers/exists_imp.pdf)
]

# "Sharing xor mutation"

| Access mode | Description        | Aliasing | Mutation |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| `T`         | ownership          | ‚ùå       | ‚úÖ       |
| `&mut T`    | mutable reference  | ‚ùå       | ‚úÖ       |
| `&T`        | shared reference   | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå       |
| `Box<T>`    | heap-allocated box | ‚ùå       | ‚úÖ       |
| `Rc<T>`     | ref-counted        | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå       |
| `Arc<T>`    | ref-counted        | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå       |

# Wasn't always this way

Had to drop two key assumptions:

* From C, copying pointers (`&mut T`) should be easy
* From ocaml, `mutable` on fields made them *always* mutable

# TIL<sup>1</sup>: Believe in your good ideas

Modern borrow checker was born with ["IMHTWAMA"](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/11/18/imagine-never-hearing-the-phrase-aliasable/), proposed Nov 2012.

But it wasn't implemented until pcwalton drove it. I was too timid to push for it.

Thanks Patrick. üíú

# Storytime

---
# Story: Understanding our audience

Takeaways:

* Your first target should be the ones who can't get what they want.

---
# Story: first impressions matter

Takeaways:

* Great README, easy install (web if you can)

???

* Tooling: I didn't get this, I just cared about the language
* Error messages: first chance to teach your user
* Rayon's "meet cute" 

---
# Story: rustfmt

Takeaways:

* Incremental works better than all at once

---
# Story: Rust editions

Takeaways:

* Let people upgrade on *their* schedule

---
# Story: modeling, specs, and soundness

Takeaways:

* Models are tools
* Adoption requires compromises

---
# Story: non-lexical lifetimes

Takeaways:

* Simpler model ‚â†¬†Simpler to understand

---
# Interesting in helping to develop Rust?

Surprisingly few success stories:

* Case study: RFC 2229
* Case study: Ralf Jung and stacked borrows
